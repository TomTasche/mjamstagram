# mjamstagram!
mjamstagram is a website built for users of mjam.at - a very popular food-ordering website in Austria. this app is meant for people who want to see a photo of what they're going to order first. photos are uploaded by other people who ordered such food. photos are associated with the restaurant that delivered the food (because a burger of one restaurant is different to a burger from another restaurant). that's all the magic. happy eating!

#### disclaimer
this app is heavily based on one of Google's sample AppEngine applications. it's called [Photofeed] (https://developers.google.com/cloud/samples/photofeed/).
